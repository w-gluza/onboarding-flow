### About the project

The project is not connected with the backend. However, you can preview the form values in the console.log()
As the form is quite long. I decided to divide it into steps; when the step is completed, the value is stored in local storage.

I store values in local storage, assuming that the user filled out a few steps and dropped out of the form, and I believe in keeping track where
the form that was left off would provide the user with a better experience.

Also worth noting that some of the styles (like panel) could be imported from an external library like Material UI or custom design library.
However, I created all the components from scratch to keep the project light-weight.
